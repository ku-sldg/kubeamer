========

This is an initial stab at a beamer template for producing slide
presentations with a KU look, by Perry Alexander.  The Beamer template
uses KU colors and has an ITTC logo.  It is adapted from
a similar package developed for Galois, Inc by Lee Pike and modified
by Magnus Carlsson.  It assumes that you have installed the font
Trebuchet MS, but I have never gotten this to work.

- [ ] Get other fonts to work
- [ ] Move style definitions and colors into the style file
- [ ] See why the blue in the ITTC logo does not match the blue in the slides
- [ ] Make it even cooler with a Jayhawk logo
